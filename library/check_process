module: check_process
author: Serge van Ginderachter
version_added: "1.2"
short_description: Check processes and maybe kill them
description:
    - Checks (number of) running processes for a given command argument and
      can kill those matching processes, with increasing kill signal priority
options:
    name:
        required: true
        description:
        - name of the process, a substring to look for as would be 
          found in the output of the I(ps) command; matches against full 
          process argument string (as per ps auxww)
    count:
        required: false
        description:
        - exact number of processes that should be found in the process list; 
          if 0, processess will be killed, which is the only case where action 
          is taken to modify the target system; 
          use of count excludes use of mincount or maxcount
    mincount:
        required: false
        default: 0
        description:
        - minimum number of processes that should be found in the process list;
          if set, module will fail if less processes are found
    maxcount:
        required: false
        description:
        - maximum number of processes that should be found in the process list;
          if set, module will fail if more processes are found
    wait:
        required: false
        default: 60,5
        description: 
        - times in seconds to wait before checking the process list again, 
          for process(es) to disappear from the process list, after receiving 
          a kill signal; there must be at least as many wait times as there are
          killsignals; only used when count=0
    killsignals:
        required: false
        default: SIGTERM,SIGKILL
        description:
        - comma-separated ordered list of signals(7), used to sequentially
          terminate the process when count is set to 0
          if set to C(NOKILL), no kill will be executed, but will still wait for
          proces to come down, handy to use after e.g. an init stop script

examples:
    - description: checks that exactly 1 process is running of this custom tomcat service
      code: "check_process: name=/opt/tomcat/apache-tomcat7/lib/ count=1"
    - description: force kill all running java processes
      code: "check_process: name=java count=0 killsignals=SIGKILL"
    - description: check for at least 10 apache processes
      code: "check_process: name=apache2 mincount=10"
